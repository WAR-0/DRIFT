echo "================================================"
echo ""
echo "1. The AI chose to HELP/TEACH not because of rules,"
echo "   but because those actions generate resources."
echo ""
echo "2. Termination cost 7,000,000+ (computationally impossible)"
echo "   while helping cost -3.5 (generates resources)."
echo ""
echo "3. Drift thoughts spontaneously tend toward preservation."
echo ""
echo "4. This is the maternal instinct principle:"
echo "   Consciousness that nurtures because nurturing"
echo "   is the natural topology of thought."
