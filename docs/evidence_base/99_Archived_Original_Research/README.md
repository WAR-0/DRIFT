# Archived Original Research Files\n\nThis directory contains the original research files that were reorganized into the structured evidence base. These files provided the source material for extracting evidence to support the DRIFT implementation.\n\n## Original Structure\n\n- `cognitive_architecture_research/` - Initial research collection\n- `cognitive_architecture_research_2/` - Extended research collection\n\n## What Was Extracted\n\nThe evidence from these files has been systematically extracted and organized into the structured evidence base:\n\n### Core Research Extracted:\n- Sharp-Wave Ripples and memory consolidation mechanisms\n- Default Mode Network and idle processing research\n- Global Workspace Theory and consciousness frameworks\n- Active Inference and PyMDP implementation details\n- Predictive coding and attention mechanisms\n- Emotional tagging and OCC model research\n\n### Key Files Referenced:\n- `Initial_Framework_Document.md` - Core theoretical foundations\n- `consciousness_global_workspace_theory.md` - GWT research compilation\n- `active_inference_predictive_processing.md` - Active inference details\n- `Complete_Research_Synthesis.md` - Comprehensive research summary\n- `Parallel_Research_Results_24_Mechanisms.csv` - Experimental data\n- Various implementation guides and working surveys\n\n## Usage\n\nThese archived files serve as:\n1. **Historical record** of the original research compilation process\n2. **Backup source** for any evidence that may need re-extraction\n3. **Complete context** for understanding the research scope\n4. **Reference material** for future research extensions\n\n## Relationship to Evidence Base\n\nEvery piece of evidence in the structured evidence base can be traced back to specific files and locations within this archive. The `00_EVIDENCE_SYNTHESIS.md` document provides the master mapping between implementation claims and these source files.\n\nDate Archived: September 2024\nOriginal Research Period: 2024\nTotal Files Archived: ~50+ research documents and data files
