## Usage Guidelines for Agents

### For Research Continuation:
1. Start with final reports in `01_final_reports/` for comprehensive overview
2. Reference specific technical details in `03_implementation_details/`
3. Check `04_emerging_projects/` for latest developments
4. Use `05_commercial_analysis/` for market context

### For Implementation Projects:
1. Begin with `github_repositories_code_implementations.md` for available code
2. Review `benchmarks_evaluation_metrics_guides.md` for assessment frameworks
3. Consult specific architecture files in `02_core_research/` for theoretical foundation

### For Business Analysis:
1. Focus on `05_commercial_analysis/` for market trends
2. Reference `04_emerging_projects/` for competitive landscape
3. Use final reports for executive summaries

## Key Research Insights

### Most Mature Implementations:
- ACT-R (multiple language implementations)
- Active Inference (pymdp as primary framework)
- Predictive Coding (specialized applications)

### Emerging Trends:
- Lightweight cognitive architectures
- Edge computing integration

- Consciousness assessment tools

### Commercial Opportunities:
- $10.35 billion market for cognitive applications by 2030
- 78% of organizations using AI in 2024
- Major funding rounds in cognitive AI startups

## File Naming Convention

- `FINAL_` prefix indicates primary deliverable documents
- Descriptive names indicate content focus
- Chronological organization (01, 02, etc.) for logical progression
- Underscores separate words for agent-friendly parsing

## Next Steps for Agents

1. **Implementation Projects:** Use technical files to build cognitive systems
2. **Research Extensions:** Identify gaps and continue investigation
3. **Commercial Applications:** Leverage market analysis for business development
4. **Academic Collaboration:** Connect with researchers and labs identified in the research
