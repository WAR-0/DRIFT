# Active Inference and PyMDP Evidence

## Overview
This document provides evidence supporting the DRIFT implementation of Active Inference mechanisms using PyMDP for exploration and free energy minimization.

## Key Findings from Research

### Active Inference Theory
**Claim:** Active Inference is a theory of adaptive action selection based on the Free Energy Principle.

**Evidence:**
> Active Inference is a theory of adaptive action selection for agents proposed by Karl Friston. It's based on the Free Energy Principle and characterizes perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference. The theory provides a way of understanding sentient behavior through minimizing free energy.

## DRIFT Implementation Connections

### ActiveInferenceAgent Class
- **Implementation:** PyMDP agent for drift exploration in DRIFT architecture
- **Evidence Basis:** Based on free energy principle and active inference theory
- **Code Reference:** Lines 179-218 in implementation_guide.md

### Free Energy Minimization
**Claim:** Active inference minimizes surprise while seeking preferred observations.

**Evidence Implementation:**
> Generate action for exploration based on expected free energy
> [verified] Minimizes surprise while seeking preferred observations

**Source:** DRIFT implementation_guide.md lines 212-217

### Exploration Mechanism
- **Implementation:** Uses A, B, C, D matrices for state-action exploration
- **Evidence Basis:** Standard Active Inference formulation with:
  - A matrix: observations given states
  - B matrix: state transitions given actions  
  - C matrix: preferences over observations
  - D prior: initial state beliefs

## Computational Model Implications

The research supports the DRIFT approach of:
1. Free energy minimization for exploration
2. Probabilistic inference for action selection
3. Biomimetic cognitive processes
4. Integration with other cognitive architectures
5. Surprise minimization while seeking novelty
