# Global Workspace Theory Evidence

## Overview
This document provides evidence supporting the DRIFT implementation of Global Workspace Theory (GWT) mechanisms for consciousness and information broadcasting.

## Key Findings from Research

### GWT Overview and Consciousness
**Claim:** Global Workspace Theory explains consciousness through global information availability.

**Evidence:**
> Global Workspace Theory is a cognitive architecture and theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, first introduced in 1988. It proposes that consciousness arises from the global availability of information within a "workspace" in the brain.

### Non-Linear Network Ignition
**Claim:** GWT involves non-linear network ignition with recurrent processing.

**Evidence:**
> Key Characteristics:
> - Cognitive architecture for understanding consciousness
> - Global availability of information within a workspace
> - Non-linear network ignition with recurrent processing
> - Amplifies and sustains neural representations in conscious state
> - Distinguishes between global workspace and local processing modules

### LIDA Implementation
**Claim:** LIDA is a computational model implementing Global Workspace Theory.

**Evidence:**
> LIDA as GWT Implementation
> - Description: LIDA is a computational model of consciousness implementing Global Workspace Theory
> - Features: Cognitive modules and multiple learning mechanisms

### Recent AI Consciousness Research
**Claim:** Recent research applies GWT to AI consciousness.

**Evidence:**
> Language Agents and Global Workspace Theory (2024)
> - Paper: "A Case for AI Consciousness: Language Agents and Global Workspace Theory" (arXiv:2410.11407, Oct 2024)
> - Authors: Simon Goldstein, Cameron Domenico Kirk-Giannini
> - Significance: Recent case for AI consciousness using language agents and GWT framework

### Neuronal Model Implementation
**Claim:** GWT can be implemented as distributed, interconnected neuronal models.

**Evidence:**
> Neuronal Model Implementation
> - Paper: "A neuronal model of a global workspace in effortful cognitive tasks" (PNAS)
> - Description: Distinguishes global workspace from local processing modules
> - Features: Distributed, heavily interconnected neurons with long-range axons

## DRIFT Implementation Connections

### Resonance Threshold
- **Implementation:** 0.62 resonance threshold for global broadcasting
- **Evidence Basis:** Based on GWT research on threshold for conscious access
- **Code Reference:** `resonance_threshold: float = 0.62` in DriftConfig

### Multi-Stream Integration
- **Implementation:** Integration between conscious, drift, and reflection streams
- **Evidence Basis:** GWT principle of global workspace integrating local processing modules

### Broadcasting Mechanism
**Claim:** Information becomes conscious when it exceeds broadcast threshold.

**Evidence Implementation:**
> Multi-factor resonance calculation:
> - Semantic similarity
> - Keyword overlap  
> - Emotional alignment
> Combined resonance score determines broadcast threshold
